# You-Wish-This-Was-Fake-News

The idea -
- Create a webpage that shows recent Donald Trump News.
- To do this I will have to take information snippets from other websites and repost/link them on mine.
- To start I am aiming to have only one page that is auto refreshing with new updated Trump news.
- It will be laid out similar to the imgur homepage but with all the posts being seemlessly connected together with a slightly different format on each line.
- I will either incorperate his twitter posts within the collage or I will create a side panel with a stream of his twitter posts.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dev-academy-challenges/[your-app].git
cd [your-app] && npm install
```

To start the development server with a watcher that refreshes your browser, run `npm start`. The assets built by webpack are placed in `server/static`. This folder is defined as a static folder in an Express.js server that can be started with `npm run server`.

Additional components should be placed in `client/components`.
